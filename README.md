We are proud to announce that in YEAR 3: we are scaling the sesh., aka putting 5 on it at scale, aka the infinite blunt glitch, aka the 401k for blunts , aka bringing the rotation to the commons, aka a canna-network state, aka the treasury for your local sesh, aka the medicare for mary ðŸš€ðŸ’¸

The wait is finally over. This 4.20 starts the unlimited sesh fund, where an OUNCE is auctioned off every day forever right into the sesh fund and OUNCERS decide what seshes around the world forever. 1/4.20 of the collection is allocated to OG Validators. 

Bid for the future of blunts at https://blunts.wtf
