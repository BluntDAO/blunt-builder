# Nouns Yellow Collective Auction Site

The Yellow Collective is a new onchain club on the BASE Ethereum L2 network, designed to support and empower artists and creatives in the Nouns and Superchain ecosystems.

The DAO was built using [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build), and this custom auction site was bootstrapped using the template here: [neokry/noun-site](https://github.com/neokry/noun-site)
