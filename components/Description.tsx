              The Yellow Collective is a new onchain club on the BASE Ethereum
              L2 network, designed to support and empower artists and creatives

              ecosystems. One Collective Noun will be auctioned off here every
              day, forever. Auction proceeds will be used to host art contests
              and pay commissions to creatives in our communities, in

              Minting a Collective Noun is a signal to your network that you
              love Nouns, that you believe in the power of Ethereum L2s like
              BASE, Zora and Optimism, and that you are a modern day, onchain,
              patron of the arts. Plus, they look pretty cool!
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh and, why ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù? Well, because yellow is bright and
              optimistic, it{"'"}s one of the original brand colors of Nouns
              DAO, as well as the main logo color for The Noun Square, and the
              name is also an homage to Purple DAO and all the good they have
              done for the Farcaster ecosystem. And finally, it{"'"}s just a
              great meme too! üü°

              They all sport the same distinctive Yellow Collective Noggles (so
              that we can always tell they{"'"}re family!) And in lieu of the
              ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and ‚Äúcool‚Äù backgrounds of classic Nouns, Collective Nouns
              backdrops are either ‚ÄúBased‚Äù (light BASE blue) or ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù (light
              TYC Yellow.) At launch, we{"'"}ve used the bodies and accessories
              from the original Nouns collection (with a couple Easter Eggs
              thrown in.) That{"'"}s the power of CC0!

              not?)
